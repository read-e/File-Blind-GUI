# File-Blind-GUI
A Python GUI application that allows you to blind files with random names and create an answer key

## Prerequisites 
 - 🐍 Have python installed
 - 🖼️ Make a backup !

## Instructions
1. Download "main.py"
2. Open a terminal, ```CD``` to the folder with the script
3. Enter ```python ./main.py``` to run the program
4. Select randomize, choose the folder, and confirm your choice

The answer key will be created in the same directory that the folder exists in.

## Troubleshooting
1. ``` Python : The term 'Python' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program. Check the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.```
  
  Try "python3" instead of "python." Make sure you have Python installed. If you do, this likely means you need to add Python to your path variable (you don't need to insall anything new if you already have Python)
